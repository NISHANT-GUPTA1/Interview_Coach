# Test the Speech Recognition and Auto-TTS Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Speech Recognition Error Handling
- ✅ Added retry counter to prevent infinite auto-retry loops
- ✅ Implemented exponential backoff for network errors
- ✅ Better error messages for different error types
- ✅ Manual retry resets the auto-retry counter
- ✅ Maximum 3 auto-retries before requiring manual intervention

### 2. Improved Auto-TTS Functionality 
- ✅ Fixed speaking state management with proper callback
- ✅ Speech service now calls completion callback to update UI
- ✅ Removed conflicting `finally` block that was stopping speaking indicator
- ✅ Enhanced fallback TTS with proper error handling

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Speech Recognition Network Errors
1. Open the interview page
2. Try to use speech recognition 
3. If you get network errors, the system should:
   - Show helpful error message mentioning HTTPS
   - Auto-retry up to 3 times with increasing delays
   - Allow manual retry that resets the counter

### Test 2: Auto-TTS Functionality
1. Start an interview
2. Questions should automatically speak in the selected language
3. The AI avatar should show "Speaking..." indicator
4. The indicator should stop when speech completes
5. Next questions should also auto-speak after user submits answer

### Test 3: Multilingual Support
1. Select Hindi/Tamil/Telugu language
2. Questions should translate and speak in selected language
3. Speech recognition should work for the selected language
4. Error messages should be clear and helpful

## Technical Improvements Made

### MultilanguageSpeechService (lib/multilingual-speech-service.ts)
```typescript
// Added retry counter
private retryCount: number = 0;

// Enhanced error handling with exponential backoff
// Better error messages for different error types
// Reset retry counter on successful start
// Manual reset method for user-initiated retries
```

### Interview Page (app/working-interview/page.tsx)
```typescript
// Fixed TTS callback to properly manage speaking state
await multiLanguageSpeechService.speak(textToSpeak, selectedLanguage, () => {
  setAiAvatarSpeaking(false);
});

// Manual retry resets counter
multiLanguageSpeechService.resetRetryCount()
```

## Expected Results
- Network errors should be handled gracefully with auto-retry
- Questions should automatically speak when displayed
- Speech recognition should be more reliable
- Error messages should be helpful and actionable
- Manual retries should work effectively
