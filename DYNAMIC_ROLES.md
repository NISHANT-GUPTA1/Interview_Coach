# 🎯 Dynamic Role Selection Feature

## ✅ Issue Fixed: Goal-Based Role Selection

### Problem Solved:
- **Before**: Role dropdown showed the same technical interview roles regardless of selected goal
- **After**: Role dropdown now shows relevant roles based on the selected goal

### How It Works:

#### 1. **Technical Interview** 🖥️
When you select "Technical Interview", you'll see roles like:
- Software Engineer
- Frontend Developer
- Backend Developer
- Full Stack Developer
- Data Scientist
- ML Engineer
- DevOps Engineer
- Product Manager
- System Architect
- Tech Lead
- Engineering Manager
- QA Engineer
- Mobile Developer
- UI/UX Designer
- Business Analyst

#### 2. **Presentation Skills** 🎤
When you select "Presentation Skills", you'll see roles like:
- Sales Executive
- Marketing Manager
- Team Lead
- Project Manager
- CEO/Founder
- Business Development
- Public Speaker
- Trainer/Coach
- Consultant
- Product Manager
- Account Manager
- HR Manager
- Event Manager
- Academic Presenter

#### 3. **Group Discussion** 👥
When you select "Group Discussion", you'll see roles like:
- Team Leader
- Project Manager
- Department Head
- HR Manager
- Consultant
- Business Analyst
- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Operations Manager
- Marketing Lead
- Strategy Manager
- Community Manager
- Facilitator
- Group Coordinator

#### 4. **Language Fluency** 🗣️
When you select "Language Fluency", you'll see roles like:
- Customer Service Representative
- Sales Representative
- Teacher/Instructor
- Interpreter/Translator
- Tour Guide
- Call Center Agent
- Content Creator
- Public Relations
- Radio/TV Host
- Language Coach
- International Business
- Diplomat
- Travel Consultant
- Voice Over Artist

### Smart Features:

#### 🔄 **Automatic Role Clearing**
- When you change your goal, if your previously selected role doesn't fit the new goal, it automatically clears
- This prevents mismatched combinations like "Language Fluency" + "DevOps Engineer"

#### 📊 **Dynamic Placeholder Text**
- Shows how many roles are available for each goal
- Example: "Choose from 15 technical interview roles..." or "Choose from 14 presentation skills roles..."

#### ✨ **Goal-Specific Descriptions**
- The role selection card description updates to show which goal you're preparing for
- Example: "Roles for Technical Interview - Choose your target position"

### Technical Implementation:

```typescript
// Dynamic role generation based on goal
const getRolesByGoal = (goalId: string): string[] => {
  switch (goalId) {
    case "interview":
      return ["Software Engineer", "Frontend Developer", ...] 
    case "presentation":
      return ["Sales Executive", "Marketing Manager", ...]
    case "group-discussion":
      return ["Team Leader", "Project Manager", ...]
    case "fluency":
      return ["Customer Service Representative", ...]
    default:
      return ["Software Engineer", "Product Manager", ...]
  }
}

// Automatic role clearing when goal changes
const handleGoalSelection = (goalId: string) => {
  setSelectedGoal(goalId)
  
  if (selectedRole) {
    const newValidRoles = getRolesByGoal(goalId)
    if (!newValidRoles.includes(selectedRole)) {
      setSelectedRole("") // Clear incompatible role
    }
  }
}
```

### User Experience Improvements:

1. **More Relevant Practice**: Users get interview questions and scenarios specific to their actual career path
2. **Better Goal Alignment**: Each goal now has roles that make sense for that type of practice
3. **Clearer Navigation**: Users understand which roles are available for their selected goal
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: No need to manually clear selections when switching between different goals

### Testing the Feature:

1. **Visit the homepage** at `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Select "Technical Interview"** - See technical roles
3. **Choose a role** like "Software Engineer"
4. **Switch to "Language Fluency"** - Notice the role clears automatically
5. **See new roles** like "Customer Service Representative" appear
6. **Dynamic placeholder** shows "Choose from 14 language fluency roles..."

This creates a much more intuitive and relevant user experience! 🎉
